                The Star Trek film series is the cinematic arm of the Star Trek franchise. Paramount Pictures began work on a Star Trek film in 1975 after several requests from series creator Gene Roddenberry. The studio scrapped the project two years later in favor of a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II, featuring the original cast. However, after the huge success of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Paramount changed its mind again, canceling production on the series and adapting its pilot episode into the 1979 film Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Another five films starring the original cast followed.

                The franchise anticipated many of the devices and technology used today, including the Tablet PC, PDA and cell phones. Several of his phrases have entered popular vocabulary. In 1976, after a letter-writing campaign, NASA named its prototype space shuttle the Enterprise. Years later, the opening credits sequence of Star Trek: Enterprise would include scenes from the space shuttle.

                In addition to Star Trek's technological innovations, one of its greatest and most significant contributions to the history of television was its multiracial and multicultural cast. This became common on television from the 1980s onwards, but in the 1960s it was controversial and risky. On the bridge of the Enterprise there was a Japanese pilot, a Russian navigator, a black communications officer, a Scottish engineer, and an alien first officer. Also, controversial at the time, was the first planned interracial kiss in American television history, between Kirk and Uhura in the episode "Plato's
                Stepchildren".
